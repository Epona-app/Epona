## Who, What, Why
Best practice utilizes the format: As a <_who_>, I want <_what_> so that <_why_>

This statement outlines which (1) persona(s) this body of work is mainly for, (2) what the desired outcome is, and (3) the intent behind the work. This avoids describing _how_ so we can focus on outcomes and not just doing work.

### Acceptance Criteria 
Testable statements describing the "definition of done" for the work. Outline any additional specific constraints a solution must meet or implementation details. Here is where you can shape the _how_

Example Formats:
Given <_a context_>, Then <_observable consequences_>
When <_some action_>, Then< _observable consequences_>

#### KPIs
Describe how success will be measured and what leading indicators the team will have to know if success has been hit.

#### Stakeholders
Who needs to be kept up-to-date, included in discussions, or updated along the way. Stakeholders can be individual contributors, community members, as well as other teams working on dependent or related things.

## Prioritization
### Scope
Time Estimate:
Story Points: (XX)
How big is this undertaking? Is there another issue of similar or relative perceived effort, (ie "about three times bigger" or "1/2 the effort"). 

### Dependencies
What resources are needed, and what might potentially block this from hitting the projected end date. What other work, projects, or teams may this undertaking affect.

### Cost of Delay
What's the opportunity cost of not having this delivered (Think in terms of either per year, per month, per week). Is there a date or dependency that results in the project being less valuable if delivered later than such date.

## Sprint Readiness
[] Team understands the user stories, intent of work, and what done means
[] Work is scoped
[] Has been prioritized in backlog list

## Implementation Notes
You can describe any specific notes regarding implementation if necessary
