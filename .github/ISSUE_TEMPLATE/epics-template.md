## User Stories
Collection of user stories outlining what the desired outcome is, which persona(s) this body of work is mainly for, and the intent behind the work. Use the format "As a <who>, I want <outcome> so that <goal/intent>

## Acceptance Criteria 
Testable statements describing what "done" for the work means.

## KPIs
Describe how success will be measured and what leading indicators the team will have to know if success has been hit.

## Stakeholders
Who needs to be kept up-to-date, included in discussions, or updated along the way. Stakeholders can be individual contributors, community members, as well as other teams working on dependent or related things.

## Dependencies
What resources are needed, and what might potentially block this from hitting the projected end date. What other work, projects, or teams may this undertaking affect.

## Cost of Delay
What's the opportunity cost of not having this delivered (Think in terms of either per year, per month, per week). Is there a date or dependency that results in the project being less valuable if delivered later than such date.

##Sprint Readiness
[] Team understands the user stories, intent of work, and what done means
[] Work is scoped
[] Has been prioritized in backlog list
